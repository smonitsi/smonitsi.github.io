In the course "Command-line tools for linguists" I learned the basics of 
command-line tools. The course was divided in 4 modules

###Module 1

###Module 2

###Module 3

###Module 4

###Final project

Here you can see my final project: it is this site. While making this site, 
I used the tools I learned on previous modules.
